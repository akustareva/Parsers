# Parsers
 - [Recursive parser](https://github.com/akustareva/Parsers/tree/master/Recursive%20parser/src) - Pascal variables declaration block parsing using recursive descent parser.
 - [Pascal to C Converter](https://github.com/akustareva/Parsers/tree/master/Pascal%20to%20C%20Converter) - Translator Pascal programs to C programs. Only some subset  of Pascal language was picked for that task. Translator was written using ANTLR tool.
 - [My Parsers Generator](https://github.com/akustareva/Parsers/tree/master/My%20Parsers%20Generator) - My own tool for generating parsers for LL(1) grammars. It works like ANTLR.
